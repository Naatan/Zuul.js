Zuul is a project I started with the intend of creative a UI framework
that is compatible with the API's and behavior of XUL.

This will effectively mean two things

 1. It will be relatively simple to port UI written in XUL to Zuul
 2. You will be able to build desktop UI using HTML, whilst stil using desktop UI methodology.
 
## Building

```
npm install
npm install -g gulp
gulp electron
```
